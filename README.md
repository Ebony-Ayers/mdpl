# Modern Data Processing Language
MDPL is a language which aims to enable high performance applications with out the dificulty of c/c++. The main aims of the language are:
- Fast, scalable, and maintainable development of high performance and real time applications.
- Complete memory safety.
- Easy utilisation of modern processor cababilities (SIMD, multithreading, cache locality, etc).

MDPL is not intended for:
- Scripting.
- Rapid prototyping.
- Web development.

MDPL is a strictly typed procedural language focused on DOD (Data Orientged Design). True OOP (Object Oriented Programing) is only possible through abuse of language features and as such is not recommended. Through the use of bindings one can acheive most of the features of OOP notably execept for polymorphism.

There is currently no support for embedded systems nor is it on the roadmap. However that does not mean it will not come at some point in the future.
